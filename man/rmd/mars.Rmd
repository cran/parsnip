# Engine Details

Engines may have pre-set default arguments when executing the model fit call. 
For this type of model, the template of the fit calls are below.

## earth

```{r earth-reg}
mars() %>% 
  set_engine("earth") %>% 
  set_mode("regression") %>% 
  translate()
```

```{r earth-cls}
mars() %>% 
  set_engine("earth") %>% 
  set_mode("classification") %>% 
  translate()
```

Note that, when the model is fit, the `earth` package only has its  namespace
loaded. However, if `multi_predict` is used, the package is  attached.


## Parameter translations

The standardized parameter names in parsnip can be mapped to their original names
in each engine that has main parameters:

```{r echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
parsnip::convert_args("mars")
```
